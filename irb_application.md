### **1. Research Plan**

**1.1 Study Purpose and Significance**  
This study aims to address "iterative learning loss" in current LLM training methodologies by investigating the impact of incorporating complete interaction loops, including errors, corrections, and clarifications, on model honesty, assumption-making behavior, and task accuracy. The research seeks to compare traditional training methods with iterative, collaborative approaches to improve AI honesty and reduce harmful outputs.

**1.2 Research Methodology**  
The study will collect data through two parallel streams:  
- **Stream A (Control):** Traditional interactions with standard LLM responses.  
- **Stream B (Experimental):** Iterative collaboration with models trained to seek clarifications.  

Participants will engage in tasks across categories such as professional tasks, creative & analytical tasks, and decision support. Data collection will focus on authentic human-AI interactions, ensuring real-world authenticity and completeness.

**1.3 Participant Recruitment**  
- **Target:** 250-300 volunteers from diverse backgrounds.  
- **Demographics:** Age, education, technical expertise, cultural background.  
- **Participation:** Voluntary, no compensation to avoid bias.  
- **Ethics:** IRB approval, informed consent, and data anonymization.

### **2. Methodology**

**2.1 Data Collection**  
Participants will interact with AI models through a secure online platform, with conversations recorded and stored anonymously. Data will include:  
- **Stream A:** Polished prompt-response pairs.  
- **Stream B:** Complete conversation threads, including clarifications and corrections.

**2.2 Use Case Categories**  
- **Professional Tasks:** Resume tailoring, technical documentation.  
- **Creative & Analytical:** Story writing, research summarization.  
- **Decision Support:** Personal guidance, educational content.

**2.3 Instruction Following Analysis**  
The study will measure how models handle implicit requests, focusing on instruction adherence, task accuracy, and user intent alignment.
